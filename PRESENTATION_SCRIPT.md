## **[0:00-0:15] Hook & Problem (15 seconds)**

*"Raise your hand if you've ever stood in front of a restaurant menu, overwhelmed by choices, trying to figure out what's actually healthy AND fits your budget."*

*"We've all been there. With rising food costs and growing health awareness, making optimal dining decisions has become a real challenge. That's why we built **Menu Max** - an AI-powered personal nutrition advisor that turns any restaurant menu into intelligent recommendations."*

## **[0:15-0:45] Solution Overview (30 seconds)**

*"Menu Max uses cutting-edge AI to solve this problem in three simple steps:"*

1. **"Scan any menu** - camera, photo, PDF, or website URL"
2. **"Set your goals** - maximize protein per dollar, minimize calories, avoid allergens, whatever matters to you"
3. **"Get instant recommendations** - with complete nutritional breakdowns and cost analysis"

*"But here's what makes us special - we're not just another nutrition app. We're building a **community intelligence platform** where every menu scan benefits everyone else."*
